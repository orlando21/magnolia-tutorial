Mobile AR help comes in many forms. At the moment, the most frequently used device is a hand-held such as a smartphone or tablet. A hand-held device for AR is both a blessing and a curse; the blessing comes from recent advances in mobile computing power that offer excellent realtime rendering of scenes. The curse comes from having to constantly switch between your tablet and other tools when executing a workflow.

Ideally a user should work hands free in order to minimize attention switching, and head-mounted displays (HMDs) offer an ideal solution. But HMD development hasn’t been smooth sailing as earlier versions were known to be heavy and costly. Recently things are looking brighter as technology continues to offer smaller and lighter HMDs, such as the Epson Moverio BT-200 or the Vuzix M100.

### Areas that benefit most from mobile AR help

Scenarios where users need to physically interact with machinery or equipment (and other kinds of real-world objects) are prime candidates for mobile AR help. Examples of such industries include aircraft, shipbuilding, automotive, resource extraction, and others. Even users maintaining software and hardware in IT stand to benefit, as AR technology can optimize physical maintenance of data centers and network nodes.

### Use cases

Even though the technology is only beginning to enter mainstream awareness, a number of possible use cases already stand out.

- **Corrective and preventive maintenance of machinery and equipment**. In industrial scenarios, users often consult several sources of information to maintain complex equipment. The higher the complexity and safety relevance of equipment, the longer and more expensive the learning process, which often also includes both training and supervised time with experts. AR technology offers guided steps directly in the user’s field of vision, aggregating diverse technical content in a number of ways. For example, existing CAD and 3D product models can be optimized and reused in AR-enabled workflows. Videos and other corporate training content can be added to scenes. Lastly, employees might add their own notes and other feedback to steps. These augmented instructions can either be either presented as a linear sequence (i.e., step by step), or as a user-driven sequence that supports decision making. In the latter case, users choose their own sequence of steps. For example, when disassembling a motorcycle, you can start by removing either the front or back wheel.
- **Procedure walk-throughs and/or training with a remote expert**. Network-enabled AR technology can also promote collaboration among remote users. For example, an expert can access a camera on a user’s HMD to provide audio instructions, perhaps even adding virtual objects to a scene. Such remote collaboration can also be used for on-site training.

### Local vs. remote processing

Processing and data storage for augmented reality solutions can also be accomplished via distributed client-server architectures. In cases where the device doesn’t have sufficient processing power or storage capacity for the AR application, or where security is a concern, a WLAN server connection can be provided.

### Content strategy for AR help

The key word in AR is augmented, which means to increase or extend. Or put another way, augmented reality doesn’t subtract from existing infrastructures and information; it destroys nothing. Mobile AR help solutions can be built on top of existing infrastructures using commercially available devices and software.

Depending on the tasks, maintenance procedures for AR help can range from complex repair steps for aircraft engines, to simple procedures for checking the oil in your car (Sebastian Schillinger, the Audi project manager of the AR help app eKurzinfo referred to the AR manual as the quick reference guide of the future).

An AR help project brings together subject matter experts, developers, web and graphic (CAD) designers, ergonomics experts, and technical authors to develop the augmentation of selected procedures and topics from existing manuals and information repositories in the enterprise.

When embarking on industrial AR projects, designers and other stakeholders should ask the following questions:

- What is the scope of the project and what benefits are we aiming for?
- Which existing procedures and topics from manuals and other user information repositories can we use? In many cases, procedures in written form have already been reviewed and certified, and are ready to augment. This is another way of asking how to integrate AR technology into existing workflows.
- What relevant product information exists elsewhere in the enterprise? For example, AR teams can leverage asset management systems, such as from SAP and Salesforce.com, to find 3D models of parts for model-based tracking.
- Are there security issues? These may dictate the extent to which composed scenes are processed and rendered locally on AR devices, or on remote servers.

In general, AR help systems should be treated as digital assets like any other, to be developed and managed using an enterprise’s content management system and other infrastructure.

### Costs

Despite the emergence of a number of software SDKs and devices for augmented reality, AR help is a nascent technology and industrial projects still require customized software development. For example, scenes must be geared to the local conditions where employees will actually be using the system. Whether developed with in-house resources or with consultants from a specialist AR software provider, AR system development is still costly in terms of research, labor, and hardware.

Currently, only larger firms can shoulder the development costs needed to realize the benefits in efficiency that AR brings. In the future, we can expect two major trends to continue to bring costs down:

- The decreasing cost (with increasing processing power and memory and battery capacity) of mobile computing devices.
- The appearance of authoring tools and integrated development environments that aggregate standard development tasks, making it cheaper in terms of time and labor to author AR solutions.

### Players

Currently there are a number of industrial AR help providers, and it’s worth taking a look at their case studies to get a better idea of real-world implementations of AR help.
