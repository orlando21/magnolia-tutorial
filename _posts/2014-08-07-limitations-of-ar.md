title: Limitations of augmented reality technology

While much is written about augmented reality and how it will integrate data visualization with the real world, it's important to bear in mind current limitations. We're simply nowhere near a world where everything's ubiquitously and flawlessly tagged and animated through your contact lens.

### Underpowered devices and bulky smartglasses

Both the prevalence of camera phones and recent increases in mobile computing power are important drivers of software development for augmented reality, and it's easy to see why media attention is mostly focused on applications in marketing and gaming. Marketing and gaming companies are early adopters of the technology (besides the [military](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2640869/Google-glass-war-US-military-reveals-augmented-reality-soldiers.html)), and they are slowly coming around to the fact they can attract customers who are eager to experience AR by pointing and clicking with their smartphones.

However, technology in currently available smartphones wasn't developed with AR in mind, and this is apparent to anyone who's downloaded and used an augmented reality application. Brainberry Global has written an [interesting article](http://brainberryglobal.com/3-biggest-problems-facing-augmented-reality-today-fix/) on the biggest shortcomings faced by AR technology, beginning with the fact that, as they put it, the overlaid graphics are more "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" than "Avatar."

When someone mentions augmented reality and smartglasses, one tends to think of Google Glass, although [battery performance is an issue](https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/06/epson-and-metaio-get-us-back-on-track-for-wearable-augmented-reality/) with Glass when it comes to the intensive processing needed to correctly render AR. The higher you move up the smartglass food chain, the bulkier the devices tend to get, which also limits their use.

### Still no perfect input or interaction

Telling a device that's on your face what to do isn't easy. The question of how to interact with your smartglasses has pitted the brightest minds of the industry against each other, with each smartglass manufacturer presenting a seemingly novel way to input user commands.

My own Epson Moverio BT-200 comes with a trackpad that allows me to move a cursor around an Android desktop that is projected on my field of view, much like a mouse cursor in a Windows environment. But this way of interacting with the device is slow and tedious.

The upshot of this is that I'm desperate for innovation in how I communicate with my smartglasses.

### The big money is still on the sidelines

For a number of reasons, venture capital and some big-name technology companies have still not [invested in a big way](http://venturebeat.com/2014/05/29/augmented-reality-wheres-the-venture-capital/). This means we're still very early stage with the technology, and it will take longer for the famous Gartner hype cycle to play out.

### Areas where AR can be beneficial

Despite these and other limitations, some industries are already benefitting from AR. The web abounds with case studies from the so-called "industrial AR" segment, which includes augmented maintenance and training procedures. In such environments that feature a limited scope of requirements for object recognition and graphical overlays, customized solutions can bring appropriate payoffs in efficiency and reduced costs. Applications in education also fall into such a category.
