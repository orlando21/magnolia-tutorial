After finishing the [Frontend Development](https://www.bloc.io/frontend-development-bootcamp) course, I had learned a powerful set of tools for building responsive websites. Somehow though, it seemed something was missing. Learning how to code in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS was fine and good, but what about user experience? In mid-2016 I decided to take Bloc's [UX/UI Fundamentals](https://www.bloc.io/ux-design-bootcamp), again with the 16-week option.

To me, designers and UI experts always seemed to be part of a prestigious circle, the "UX elite." Not only was I interested in learning about prototyping and personas, but I was more than a little curious about some of the inner workings of this mysterious order.

One might say that, with both courses, I had taken Bloc's Designer career track, only I had done them backwards, as normally one takes the UX/UI course first.

### The methodology

"What makes good user experience?" The course starts with a brief explanation of this to get us thinking as we begin designing a competitor of Dropbox.

The correct way to design websites is to address users' preferences, but we all too often fall into the trap of designing according to our own tastes. Doing user research and creating personas we think fit this research is the way to go. The course emphasizes the fastest and simplest ways to: accomplish user research (by creating surveys in Google Drive), identify competitors (by writing a competitive analysis), and identify our target group (by analyzing the results of surveys we had sent out).

The result is the creation of a number of user personas, which weren't merely written down in some Word document but visually presented in an Illustrator template. In fact, what appealed to me was learning the habit of presenting ideas visually - being a writer means I'm used to expressing everything as text.

Personas are further honed by face-to-face interviews with users about their behaviors and routines. A company gains a kind of mental picture of potential customers through such efforts, gradually refining the details.

From these personas you can design how users will interact with products, and start proposing features. The challenge here is deciding (and making arguments if you're in a team) which features will appeal most to these defined personas.

Once user flows and product features are mapped out, webpages and apps are mocked up and wireframed in both low and high fidelity. This means the wireframing goes through several iterations or versions, and it's all done using a variety of tools. For example, you do a mockup in Photoshop, then turn around and repeat it in Sketch. I must admit, this was a very time-consuming and detail-oriented activity where you can be involved for hours working with layers to decide whether an image looks better 10 pixels left or right.

For me the most interesting part was learning how to prototype and test my mockups using sites like [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/). The ability to do this kind of usability testing is, in a word, awesome. The idea is that your site is crowdtested by a handful of random people (from a pool of thousands apparently) who are paid for their short visit and audio feedback. I didn't even have to submit a website, but could upload collections of PNGs of wireframed pages. Then I linked these images together in InVision. For example, if I designed a button for a page, I created a hotspot on top of the button and identified another page to link to.

Beyond learning methodologies for user requirements and testing, I also spent time finding styles, typography, colors, and logos that were appropriate to the defined user personas (a process in itself).

### The tools

I used different tools for each stage of the design cycle, for example, Draw.io to map user flows, and Balsamiq for low-fidelity wireframes. Illustrator was perfect for designing logos and creating other kinds of deliverables like color palettes and high-fidelity wireframes. For mockups (high-resolution artifacts created during the last design stage before development) I used both Photoshop and Sketch.

Photoshop is still the standard for web designers and to see this, one need only search on terms like "free design template" or "iphone mockup." Practically all the results are for PSD files. Nevertheless I found Photoshop to be a heavy and complicated tool and prefer Sketch for design work.

### Mentorship

Bloc matches you with a mentor to work with you during the course. The idea is to provide a real-world perspective on design from a practicing designer. My mentor was a self-taught mobile app designer, which is what I had preferred over someone who learned the trade in school. Mentors generally don't give you all the solutions in places where you get stuck, but try to frame the problem instead and get you to be a self-learner. I appreciated my mentor's insights into the app design world and the realities of working as a designer. He was also generally very available, answering emails within a day. Not all mentors may be so responsive however (according to what I've read) so some things are a matter of luck.

### Conclusions

The course gave me the opportunity to earn my chops on various projects, such as designing both a retail clothing website and an Android app for ordering food. It's amazing just how empowering that frontend design and development skills are, and how they can be so widely applied.
