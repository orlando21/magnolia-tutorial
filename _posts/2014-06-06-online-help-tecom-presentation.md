[Tecom Switzerland](http://tecom.ch/) hosted a presentation entitled, “Online Help, Quo Vadis?” on trends in online help. The presenter was [Marc Achtelig](http://www.carmano.com/), an independent consultant. His presentation summarized online help’s history and its near-term future.

### Help platforms

He started with an overview of the evolution of online help platforms, from the first Readme files to WinHelp, which appeared in the late 1980s and was one of the first platforms dedicated to online help. The help pages were based on RTF files, and MS Word was the Help Authoring Tool. Microsoft then published HTML Help in the mid-90s, which featured standard navigation and all topics in a single CHM file.

WebHelp was the next generation, and improved on some of the limitations of HTML Help. WebHelp is platform independent and network friendly, organizing content into smaller files. WebHelp is widely used and has adapted to the times by becoming mobile responsive. Today, HATs provide wide possibilities for generating and individualizing WebHelp.

WebHelp continues to evolve with mobile platforms, becoming more responsive and integrated into the look and feel of the overall platform. Overview pages for some WebHelp systems incorporate a clickable graphic or picture of the product at the top navigation level (so-called alternative TOCs), which enable users to easily display further information on specific parts, instead of presenting a long table of contents.

### Web-inspired ways of presenting content

The web is driving many changes and trends in online help, and this is evident in the way content is presented. For example, help content increasingly uses articles instead of the familiar narrowly defined help-based task and reference information. Writing all your content as articles causes your TOC to become flatter and less hierarchical, as the scope of an article tends to be broad and encompass a collection of topics.

According to Marc Achtelig, online help is morphing into a one-stop knowledge shop, featuring layers of knowledge that address differing information types and audiences. Also used is progressive disclosure--an interactive design technique revealing features only when users need them.

Today one often finds a help center “home page” to be the top-level entry into a help system, rather than a linear TOC.

### Types of online help

Achtelig also sees traditional user manuals disappearing, which isn’t surprising. Today, single-source publishing is already standard in many organizations, although a PDF manual rather than an online help system still accompanies many products. Customers are simply more used to reading online these days, driving a tendency to put more information online.

He also gave a good overview of the different types of online help, which I found useful given the mix of terminologies one sometimes encounters.

- **Standard help** is the traditional help system appearing in its own separate window. Think WinHelp and HTML Help.
- **Embedded help** can be found in the same window as the product or service. An example is when you must enter information for a service on the web, and see a string of explanatory text nearby.
- **Dynamic help** is embedded help that adjusts its content according to the user’s context. For example, explanations relating to a task would appear in the same window in which you are working. Instead of a display of all help topics, these explanations would be limited to what you are doing, but might also contain links to a standard help system. You could also dismiss the help to increase screen real estate.

The goal of embedded help is to appear precisely at the user’s point of confusion, but not to distract users from their tasks (as with Microsoft Clippy in the 90s). Of course, embedded and dynamic help doesn’t answer all questions, but it seeks to strike a balance between too much and too little information.

### Analytics, wikis, videos, and JavaScript

The presentation also addressed the growing importance of social media and analytics, which provide technical authors with feedback on their content. Although these can have disadvantages, such as negative user comments and poorly written user-generated content, they are a  leap in improving user documentation.

Other tools, such as wikis, videos, and screencasts enrich the user experience, as long as they are well implemented. In particular, videos and screencasts are good for explaining complex information to new audiences, but might not appeal to expert users. These should not stand alone, but form a part of the overall help system.

Lastly, Achtelig presented some jQuery plugins and their specific uses for help systems, noting these provide certain functionalities where HATs don’t. jQuery plugins are mostly open source and relatively easy to implement, especially in HTML5.

### Wrapping it up

In summary, the presentation gave a big picture view of today’s help systems and their likely direction. It is evident that the web continues to transform help technologies and connect authors with their audiences.
