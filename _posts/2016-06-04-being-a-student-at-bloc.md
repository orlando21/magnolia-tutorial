title: Taking an online coding bootcamp

After some time deliberating on the importance of frontend technologies to technical communication, I finally decided to take an online coding bootcamp. I took Bloc's [Frontend Development](https://www.bloc.io/frontend-development-bootcamp) with the 16 week option. My day job was less than full time, which was helpful.

Before signing up, I researched a number of options. As I'm not sure when I'll have time again to take an immersive half-year course, I wanted a learning experience that would offer maximum impact in terms of gaining knowledge while providing opportunities to build complex stuff. My view is that just doing programming exercises is like learning how to use a hammer and nail, while learning approaches and skills (rather than just tools) for building the facade of a small house is an entirely different undertaking.

### Getting started

What appealed to me about this type of course was the fact it offered project-based work and required commitment, which somewhat mirrors the real world. The program matches you with a mentor who is a full-time software developer, lending a professional angle when discussing assignments.

Bloc recommends doing some prework before starting. This consists of mini introductory courses in HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and some GitHub basics. These are currently offered by [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com) and are free.

Next came mentor selection. Taking into account the time difference between Europe and the US meant I had to find someone who wanted to work during mornings their time. The choice of mentor is important as they work with you throughout the course and provide answers to coding and career questions.

### Doing the projects

Bloc's course is structured in terms of projects, which in turn are divided up into checkpoints, each presenting different topics to learn and work through. The majority of the time you're working through the Foundation project, where you learn the basics of building a single page app from the ground up. This includes adding the HTML and CSS first, followed by JavaScript.

After the Foundation, you can choose from any number of smaller projects to learn specialized areas that interest you.

### Time commitment

Reading some pages on the Bloc website about what to expect, I somehow calculated around four hours per day of frontend work. However this understated the actual amount of time I spent, which soaked up a lot of time due to debugging. Many of my searches led me to StackOverflow and its advice but I found the answers there are not always usable.

My family is also very happy that my time in this course has ended.
