One question that local writing professionals might have is how to network with others in the Zurich region. I am aware of two groups that are geared specifically to writing and communication professionals. For German speakers there is Tecom Schweiz, which is associated with the German TEKOM but based in Zurich. Tecomâ€™s [website](http://www.tecom.ch/) features useful information about technical writing and has a jobs page. They have a wide following in Switzerland and occasionally host evening talks about topics such as structured writing and technical documentation, and they organize an annual day-long conference.

For English speakers the options are more limited. The Transalpine chapter of the [Society for Technical Communication](http://www.tecom.ch/) used to serve Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Switzerland, and Italy but is now apparently defunct.

Seeing the benefit of local networking, I founded Professional Writers and Communicators of Zurich. We meet once every two months or so to exchange ideas and experiences with like-minded professionals.
