It’s your first day on the job and the boss announces your task; write a user manual from scratch for the flagship product. She needs a project plan ASAP. Maybe you rise to the occasion with confidence in your  ability to soak up information from your subject matter experts and the marketing materials lying around. You know your fingers will just do their magic.

Or maybe you're overwhelmed and are not sure where to start.

### Enter the content specification

You need a roadmap, a set of requirements--and a content specification is that plan. A content spec is a document containing an analysis of the product or system, such as target audience and purpose, as well as background information such as management assumptions and constraints. It should be completed before the project even starts (if possible).

Setting your thoughts to paper before you begin the manual is the most useful aspect of a content spec, because it starts you on the path to your project plan. It explicitly states your assumptions and will help you catch any misconceptions early on. As a matter of fact, you don’t even have to call it a spec, as its information might fold neatly into other project documents.

In the following paragraphs, I list and describe each section of a good content specification. Your own spec may differ depending on your company and industry, product and market, etc.

### Product and user analysis

Good product documentation is focused on users, so you should start with users' needs and ask:

- What are they trying to accomplish with the product? This enables you to emphasize user needs throughout the text. It will also be a point of departure for task analysis later.
- What is the purpose of your document about the product? Will it be used as training material, and so on. This helps determine the design and content of your documentation. Also, name explicitly the document’s objectives, such as reducing support queries and making information easier to find.
- What are the assumptions behind the documentation project? For example, which subject matter experts will be available, what style and regulatory guidelines apply to the manual, and what is the draft/review cycle schedule?
- Who is the audience? This is the toughest part, because technical writers can seldom meet with customers. But you are writing for them, so it’s necessary to do research about personas such as their technical expertise, education level, attitudes toward the product, etc. If more than one target audience exists, then you should segment these accordingly.
- What are the constraints pertaining to the documentation, if any? Examples of constraints are policies, rules, customs or assumptions. The fact your document or user assistance might be translated into eight languages afterwards might limit the amount of callout text to insert in screenshots.
