I sometimes get asked (mainly by those looking to change in mid career) how one breaks into tech writing. Although there are many, many discussions in various LinkedIn groups on the topic, I wanted to condense my thoughts here and summarize how I answer the question.

### Benefits

First let’s look at the benefits of the job. Technical writer, information developer, content developer; whatever you call it, it‘s a title that denotes more a task than an area of responsibility. And therein lies diversity. I’m fond of saying, give me a technical writer each from five different companies and I’ll show you five very different job roles. Really, it’s hard to generalize what a technical writer does except for the fact that he or she writes for a living. But even there, some who refer to themselves as technical writers may write little or no words at all but instead write code all day, or mark up and organize content for online distribution.

A technical writer who’s also an aviation expert may assist in writing air traffic management procedures, while a tech writer working for a bank may develop internal regulations for cross-border financial transactions. Still another may be an instructional designer for a training department.

What all this means is that in working as a tech writer, the central skills of communication (particularly written) and rapid understanding of technical concepts are paramount and potentially transferrable to many domains of knowledge and human activity. While this doesn’t mean you’ll be needed everywhere, it does give a certain generalist connotation to your activities, which can provide a wide choice of fields to work in.

Another advantage of technical writing is the fact that [ageism](https://stc-sf.org/2014/03/01/march-2014-meeting-discussion-ageism-and-todays-technical-communicator/) doesn’t seem as rampant in this field as in others. Don’t get me wrong—it does exist nonetheless. But in my subjective experiences and observations over the years, it would seem its impact may not be as pronounced as in other fields like software development. Here I’m especially referring to those who may want to change careers in the middle of their professional lives. Changing careers when you’re older is never easy, but mastering new communication skills at a later age may be slightly easier than mastering technical ones.

### Learn a programming language

Wondering where the adjective in technical writer comes from? That’s right, you need to display some technical understanding of a field in order to prove you‘re generally capable of assimiliating new technical concepts. But here’s the thing. You don’t need to become an absolute expert in a programming language and be capable of being hired as a coder. I say this although, for example, many API technical writers could in fact be full-time developers. The more you know about a given field evidently doesn’t hurt your chances of being hired. But learning a language to a certain level (and preferably getting a certificate) is a good idea.

It goes without saying that it’s better to learn a widely used language like Java or C++, or even JavaScript, rather than an antiquted one with which they solved the Y2K bug.

### Learn about technical communication

There are many ways to do this, from doing your own research to taking online courses. If you’re new to the field, I would advise doing as much as you can of both.

Technical communication is an umbrella term that includes not only technical writing and editing but other fields as well, for example: information architecture, instructional design, and publication. I like the definitions given at [TechWirl](http://techwhirl.com/what-is-technical-communications/), but you’ll no doubt come across different ones, especially as some have preferred terms like information development instead of technical communication.

One thing to know is that writing and publishing are done according to conventions. For example, user manuals for print delivery are commonly divided into parts such as front matter, TOC, index, etc. They also contain metadata and cross-references that are company and domain specific. Studying technical communication as a field and learning what’s expected and the different ways you can generate and present content is a necessary part of becoming a professional.

### Join an organization

Joining a global organization such as the [Society for Technical Communication](https://www.stc.org/) or [TEKOM](http://www.technical-communication.org/) offers networking opportunities and trade journals with information on recent developments and trends. Such organizations also organize big conferences on a yearly basis (or more often), which gives you a chance to attend presentations and meet fellow professionals.

### Do work to get work

Lastly, I have to say that not only does experience trump academic credentials any day in the technical writing job market (in my opinion), but the best way to solve the chicken and egg problem of trying to get hired without experience is to work for free (or for peanuts) to develop a portfolio. This is a step that I believe is very effective and yet few seem willing to do.

You may ask, who would want to hire someone without experience, even for nothing? Well, there are many open source software initiatives that are in need of good documentation. Sites such as [OpenStack](http://docs.openstack.org/contributor-guide/index.html) and [MODX](http://docs.openstack.org/contributor-guide/index.html) apparently offer opportunities to join and contribute. What better way to break into the software documentation market than to document the latest technologies?

### Summing up

These are my opinions on how to change careers into technical writing. If you’re serious about such a change, your best bet would be to consult the tech writing LinkedIn groups (where this topic seems quite popular and is a recurring one) and to network.

What are your thoughts on breaking into tech writing? Would you do anything differently?
