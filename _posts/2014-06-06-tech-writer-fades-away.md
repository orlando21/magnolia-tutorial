title: The traditional tech writer fades away

When observing trends in technical writing, I’m sometimes reminded of the words of General Douglas MacArthur’s [1951 farewell speech to Congress](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/macarthur/filmmore/reference/primary/macspeech05.html) about old soldiers not dying, just fading away. Technical writing as a profession is not facing an untimely end, but as with other professions, it is being reshaped by technology. There is an interesting series of [articles on the death of technical writing](https://customersandcontent.com/2014/05/03/the-death-of-technical-writing-part-1/), which neatly summarizes the issues.

### The decline of the traditional tech writer

The traditional tech writer works as staff led by a manager who directs the production of copious amounts of information in big manuals. The writer documents everything, with every conceivable knowledge topic present and accounted for. As part of a dedicated team, the writer doesn’t have to worry about arcane tasks like generating business cases. They’re just a part of an efficient machine cranking out information day after day.

This is the writer we all know about, regardless of whether we ourselves match this profile. Like MacArthur’s soldier, this job description is slowly fading away in the face of technologies like cloud-based services, mobile apps, and agile development cycles. These trends are aptly described in Neal’s article.

### The rise of… other trends

So which trends seem evident?

- **Ideas over quality.** Grammar, spelling, organization, and other factors are increasingly taking a hit in web-based help and explanatory text. Not only is user documentation in startups and small companies the purview of the developer or marketing employee who writes best, but also customers are growing more tolerant of quality lapses.
- **Companies are increasingly using their docs as a marketing tool.** There used to be a time when companies feared the competition getting their hands on the manual and duplicating the features inside. These days, software companies want to present themselves and their products as "open and friendly." Opening your docs to all and sundry reaches more eyeballs in web searches.
- **The rise of user-generated content.** Websites like stackoverflow.com present user information in new ways and their format of gamified Q&A is increasingly being adopted by mainstream companies as product FAQs. While I believe the advantages of such technology cannot be overstated, the founder of Stack Overflow’s proclamation of the irrelevance of user manuals was overdone. On the other hand, such technology might open new vistas for technical writers--for example, as product community managers.
- **The traditional manual is slimming down or disappearing.** Again, here I’m referring to online products and services. There just isn’t a need to write so much, especially in view of shorter development cycles, apps featuring simple procedures, and so on. When publishing your new software on the web, why not just furnish a brief tutorial and a gamified forum of users helping users? Of course, this doesn’t mean that PDF has been unseated. On the contrary, it's still got a good run ahead. And despite the fact that nobody reads it.
- **With the need to write less, technical writing is increasingly one of many tasks of someone’s pay grade, rather than a career unto itself.** This trend owes its genesis to startup culture, where a talented person might wear many hats, such as a database admin / C++ and Java developer / marketing and technical writer, etc. This trend can also be observed in the mainstream, outside of startups.

### Countertrends

Given the above, will the traditional writer of product documentation be put on the endangered list and disappear shortly afterwards, save for a chance sighting in a rain forest in 50 years?

Perhaps not. Technical writing encompasses more than product documentation. The more regulated an industry or product is, the more likely you'll find employees who just write. For example, some industries have special compliance needs. Here in Switzerland, companies like Roche and Novartis employ teams of writers to keep up with the growing raft of FDA regulations.

Product complexity also attracts large teams. Defense and aviation are examples of industries with complex information requirements that need to be well described in order to understand products and minimize risks. S1000D and DITA are prime methodologies for organizing and publishing technical content in such industries.

### My thoughts

Regulation and complexity aren't going away any time soon. The only question is the ability of companies to deploy resources economically, while balancing safety and regulatory risks and concerns. For this reason, technical writers in a pure writing role will not go extinct in the near future. But in terms of sheer numbers, they will fade away.
