_Ed. This post describes a webinar given by AR software provider Metaio AG, subsequently bought by Apple in 2015 and now defunct._

An interesting webinar was given by Metaio, a software provider for [augmented reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality) applications. The webinar gives an overview of how augmented reality will impact business in 2014 and explained:

- Augmented reality developments in 2013, which were driven by gaming and growing mainstream awareness of wearable technology.
- Several AR business case studies. These included uses cases for performing technical maintenance, which are described below.
- Trends in embedded 3D cameras.

Metaio has been in the AR business for over a decade, and has developed all kinds of commercial applications ranging from the [IKEA AR catalog](http://mashable.com/2013/08/06/ikea-augmented-reality/) to 3D user manuals for cars.

What’s noteworthy for technical communicators was how often AR applications for providing guided help was mentioned. Small wonder, since the term “augmented reality” was supposedly coined by engineer Tom Caudell in 1990 when [he created an application](https://www.wired.com/2009/08/augmented-reality/) for guiding Boeing factory workers.

### Google Glass isn’t the only AR product

For many of the techcomm case studies, Metaio partnered with Epson in creating applications using Epson’s Moverio BT-200, a set of smart glasses that differ from Google Glass in many ways. For one thing, they’re bulkier. And they’re tethered to a control unit the size of a smartphone.

But in the realm of AR, the Moverio glasses have [some advantages](https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/06/epson-and-metaio-get-us-back-on-track-for-wearable-augmented-reality/), particularly in the enterprise space. They dedicate more processing power to AR and feature a longer battery life with full-field view over both eyes (as opposed to monocular). While Glass has captured the imagination of consumers, the Moverio seems more at home in industrial settings.

### Warehouse optimization by SAP and Vuzix

The first case study features a joint effort by [SAP](http://www.sap.com/index.html) and [Vuzix](https://www.vuzix.com/) for an AR solution that optimizes the work of warehouse employees. Workers at fulfillment centers spend their day sifting through parcels and deciding where to put them for subsequent delivery. Through the glasses, the app instantly recognizes bar codes and indicates to workers via arrows where to put packages, reducing mistakes and costs.

### Mitsubishi air conditioners

Another case study showcases AR-enabled maintenance of Mitsubishi Electric air conditioning units. Metaio teamed up with Mitsubishi and Epson to visualize maintenance instructions directly on top of the hardware. Aircon technicians maintain hundreds of different unit types per year, so the question is how to ease the flow of maintenance. The AR software recognizes each unit and places repair instructions via arrows, highlighted areas, etc., directly in the technician’s field of vision. The webinar pointed out that such AR help technology will eventually be pushed to consumer markets as well.

### Automotive industry case studies

The automotive industry is also pioneering the adoption of AR for techcomm. Two examples were presented in the webinar. The first was Volkswagen’s development of Mobile Augmented Reality Technical Assistant (MARTA) for its XL1, which claims to be the one of the most fuel-efficient cars in the world. Based on a tablet, MARTA provides XL1-specific maintenance information to mechanics.

The second case study features Audi, which developed a smartphone app to provide information to car owners for simple tasks such as changing oil and understanding the dashboard, using a smartphone’s camera.

### Key webinar takeaways

- Many corporations are still in the paper age, where the primary source of reference and task information is the standard user manual.
- This leads to the familiar problems of distributing new information. AR software with an internet connection addresses such issues.
- AR enables a hands-free approach to maintenance, guiding workers through steps without having to break the flow to refer to a nearby manual.
- AR promotes the use of visual language.
- Because wearables and AR software are based on existing ecosystems (iOS, Android, etc.), they follow the trend of BYOD infrastructures and architectures.
- AR software can also gather analytics and send these back to companies for purposes of quality improvement.
- Enterprise use cases will lead the way in AR and technical communication; workers are already accustomed to wearing hard hats, etc., so donning AR goggles would not be a stretch.
- This is in contrast to the consumer market, where wearable technologies struggle to gain fashion acceptance.
- Industrial literature is confusing

### My thoughts

In the coming years a growing number of AR applications for techcomm will appear on the market. Not only must technical communicators cope with new concepts such as guided help embedded in the field of vision, but they must also focus on communicating visually. Many current approaches such as topic-based assistance should continue to be relevant, and user information for AR will be designed with simplicity in mind to address users pain points.
