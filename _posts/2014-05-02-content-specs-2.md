After your initial analysis, planning the actual content of your guide should be a bit easier. Now comes the fun part; what will you write?

Topic-based authoring offers an efficient way to organize technical content and lends itself to reuse. The idea is to take the information you think will go into the manual, and organize it as a list of topics, each topic comprising one or more paragraphs and encapsulating a single, relevant idea or discrete piece of content.

Some writing methodologies offer a list of many different topic types but two kinds are useful: procedure and knowledge. These should cover the majority of information types you run across. Do you have a piece of information that resembles a “how to” with step-by-step instructions? It’s a procedure. What about a statement that describes what a widget is? It’s a knowledge topic.

The idea at this point is not to just start writing. Through your research, as well as interviews with subject matter experts, you should first generate a list of topic titles, which you will arrange into a table of contents.

In the beginning, your list of topics will not jump out, fully arranged in final form. If the product is completely new to you, you might first jot down a few rough steps on how to use it. For example, if you are writing a manual for a washing machine, you would first describe the user opening a slot to put in washing powder, then closing the slot and selecting different settings, and then putting clothes in, etc. From this and other rough outlines, you can generate a set of procedure topics.

And in answering what a user needs to know in order to use the product you generate a set of knowledge topics.

You give the same thought to the arrangement and sequence of topics in your manual, as well as future links among topics (see also, caution, etc.).

When building your topic list you will notice the associations among them (for example, a topic describing a diagnostic test might precede a task on how to troubleshoot your printer). From there, you group related topics into chapters and sections.

### Table of contents and project plan

Once you’re satisfied with your hierarchy of topics, you can build your TOC. The more work you put into your topic list, the less you’ll have to change in your TOC later, although it will never be 100% complete at this stage.

Creating a TOC is a top-down planning exercise and the TOC also represents the top level of user access to your content. If you are designing user assistance, you might dispense with a TOC and instead rename topic groups as “articles” and categories of articles.

Next you can estimate the time to complete each group and number of pages (for printed publications). These are critical variables for your project plan, which you complete by estimating milestones and costs. It’s also helpful to include time for review cycles in estimating the end of the project, as these can be quite long and entail dedicated hours from other staff.

### Conclusion

The content specification is an essential tool in your content strategy. The best thing about using one is it dispels uncertainty and helps you focus on writing. It’s your guide to confronting the [age-old dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns.html) of both  known unknowns and unknown unknowns, especially if it’s your first day on the job.
